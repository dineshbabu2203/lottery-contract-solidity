# lottery-contract-solidity



This contract is written by me . In this contract only user can generate random number and find winner in this smart contract , we build some extra features :-

-->Reusability via the removeAllUsers() function to reset the contract.
-->Ownership Transfer using a function to allow the current owner to transfer ownership to another address.
-->Visibility Functions like totalBalance(), deployerAddress(), and totalUser() to expose various states of the contract.
-->Winner Selection by only the owner using a randomly generated number.
